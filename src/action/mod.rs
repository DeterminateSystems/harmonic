/*! An executable or revertable step, possibly orcestrating sub-[`Action`]s using things like
    [`JoinSet`](tokio::task::JoinSet)s


[`Action`]s should be considered an 'atom' of change. Typically they are either a 'base' or
a 'composite' [`Action`].

Base actions are things like:

* [`CreateDirectory`](base::CreateDirectory)
* [`CreateFile`](base::CreateFile)
* [`CreateUser`](base::CreateUser)

Composite actions are things like:

* [`CreateNixTree`](common::CreateNixTree)
* [`CreateUsersAndGroups`](common::CreateUsersAndGroups)

During their `plan` phase, [`Planner`](crate::planner::Planner)s call an [`Action`]s `plan` function, which may accept any
arguments. For example, several 'composite' actions accept a [`CommonSettings`](crate::settings::CommonSettings). Later, the
[`InstallPlan`](crate::InstallPlan) will call [`try_execute`](StatefulAction::try_execute) on the [`StatefulAction`].

You can manually plan, execute, then revert an [`Action`] like so:

```rust,no_run
# async fn wrapper() -> Result<(), harmonic::HarmonicError> {
use harmonic::action::base::CreateDirectory;
let mut action = CreateDirectory::plan("/nix", None, None, 0o0755, true).await?;
action.try_execute().await?;
action.try_revert().await?;
#   Ok(())
# }
```

A general guidance for what determines how fine-grained an [`Action`] should be is the unit of
reversion. The [`ConfigureNixDaemonService`](linux::ConfigureNixDaemonService) action is a good
example of this,it takes several steps, such as running `systemd-tmpfiles`, and calling
`systemctl link` on some systemd units.

Where possible, tasks which could break during execution should be broken up, as uninstalling/installing
step detection is determined by the wrapping [`StatefulAction`]. If an [`Action`] is a 'composite'
its sub-[`Action`]s can be reverted piece-by-piece. So breaking up actions into faillable units is
ideal.

A custom [`Action`] can be created then used in a custom [`Planner`](crate::planner::Planner):

```rust,no_run
use std::{error::Error, collections::HashMap};
use harmonic::{
    InstallPlan,
    settings::{CommonSettings, InstallSettingsError},
    planner::{Planner, PlannerError, specific::SteamDeck},
    action::{Action, StatefulAction, ActionDescription},
};

    }

        let Self { common } = self;
        let mut map = std::collections::HashMap::default();

        map.extend(common.settings()?.into_iter());
